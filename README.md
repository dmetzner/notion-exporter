[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/notion-exporter.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/notion-exporter)

A small, dependency-light CLI that backs up **one** Notion workspace to a
timestamped directory on your disk — raw JSON, readable Markdown, browsable
HTML, and every image/file pulled local before its signed URL expires. No
hosting, no OAuth, no SaaS dashboard: point a Nextcloud / Dropbox / Syncthing
folder at the output and you have an honest archive.

## Highlights

- **Three output formats in one pass** — full-fidelity `raw/` JSON, deterministic
  `markdown/` (no `notion-to-md` dependency), and a navigable `html/` mini-site
  with sidebar, sitemap, and client-side search.
- **Rich block coverage** — math equations (KaTeX, inline + block), native
  `<audio>` / `<video>` players, YouTube / Vimeo / Loom embed iframes, fallback
  bookmark cards for other embeds, and a click-to-zoom image lightbox.
- **Kanban-style database rendering** — Notion DBs grouped by a status or
  select property render as column-grouped kanban boards in HTML; override
  with `EXPORT_DB_VIEW=auto|table|kanban` to force a specific layout.
- **Per-database view config via Notion description** — drop a
  `%%notion-exporter` JSON fence into a database's description and the
  renderer honours `view` / `groupBy` / `order` / `hideFilters` /
  `cardMeta` for that DB. See [Recipes](#per-database-view-config) for the
  full key reference. JSON only (not YAML).
- **Canonical kanban column order** — when a DB ships with its
  data-source schema, kanban columns and select / status filter chips use
  the workspace's canonical option order. Precedence: `config.order`
  (description fence) > `dataSource` schema > built-in `STATUS_RANK`
  heuristic > first-occurrence (stable). "No status" is always anchored
  last.
- **Compact card view** — inline DBs nested in a `column_list` with
  small row counts and no cover images render as a quiet card list
  instead of full table chrome, so dashboard pages stay readable. Force
  a different layout per DB via the `%%notion-exporter` fence above.
- **Type-aware database filters** — inline DB views ship per-column filter
  chips for `select` / `status`, date and number range filters, a sort
  dropdown, and URL-hash filter state so a shared link reopens the same
  filtered view. Filter strip is collapsible.
- **Page comments** — top-level comments fetched and rendered inline with
  author and timestamp (requires the integration's **Read comments**
  capability).
- **Accessible by default** — WCAG-AA contrast on every swatch in both light
  and dark themes, enforced by `pnpm contrast`.
- **Custom Markdown converter** — extend `src/export/markdown.ts` for new block
  types; behavior stays deterministic and snapshot-tested.
- **Incremental + resume on by default** — re-runs only re-fetch pages whose
  `last_edited_time` changed, and a crash mid-export picks up where it stopped.
- **Retention pruning** — keep the last N stamped exports, prune the rest.
- **Custom workspace branding** — set `EXPORT_TITLE` and `EXPORT_ICON` (emoji
  or path) for the HTML sidebar.
- **Rate-limited Notion client** — Bottleneck + exponential 429/5xx retry so
  large workspaces don't get throttled.
- **Asset deduplication** — content-addressed `assets/` directory; identical
  images appear once on disk.
- **Rerender + repair commands** — fix renderer bugs or re-sign expired asset
  URLs without re-fetching the whole workspace.

## Requirements

- **Node.js ≥ 22.19** (LTS). Earlier versions are not supported.
- **pnpm 9+** — only for working from source. Runtime install via `npm` / `npx` works without pnpm.

## Quick start

```bash
# One-shot, no install
export NOTION_TOKEN=secret_xxx
npx notion-exporter check         # verify token + visibility
npx notion-exporter export        # writes ./exports/<timestamp>/
```

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmetzner/notion-exporter
cd notion-exporter
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env              # then edit NOTION_TOKEN
pnpm dev check                    # validate setup
pnpm dev export                   # run from source via tsx
```

## Setup in 3 minutes

1. Open <https://www.notion.so/my-integrations> and create a new **internal**
   integration. Copy the secret (`secret_…`).
2. Put it in `.env` as `NOTION_TOKEN=…` (start from [`.env.example`](.env.example)).
3. In Notion, open the top-level page or teamspace you want to back up and
   click **··· → Connections → \<your integration\>**. Child pages inherit
   access — for a private workspace you typically share once at the top.
4. Run `pnpm dev check` (or `npx notion-exporter check`). If it reports
   `0 visible objects`, you haven't shared anything yet — go back to step 3.
5. **Optional — enable comments.** In the integration's **Capabilities** tab,
   tick **Read comments**. Without it, `export` silently omits the comments
   section (no error). If you grant it after a first run, do `pnpm dev export
   --force` to backfill — `rerender` reads from disk and can't pull new
   comments on its own.

## Commands

| Command    | When to use                                                                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `check`    | Smoke-test `NOTION_TOKEN` and list how many objects the integration sees.   |
| `export`   | The main one. Crawl, fetch, render, write a fresh stamped export directory. |
| `rerender` | Regenerate Markdown/HTML/sitemap/search from existing `raw/` JSON — no API. |
| `repair`   | Retry assets that failed last run (re-signs expired Notion S3 URLs).        |

### `export` flags

| Flag               | Default      | Effect                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-f`, `--force`    | off          | Full fresh export: ignore previous output, refetch everything (= `--no-incremental --no-resume`). |
| `--no-incremental` | off          | Re-fetch every page even if `last_edited_time` is unchanged (default: incremental ON).       |
| `--no-resume`      | off          | Start fresh instead of continuing a partial export (default: resume ON).                     |
| `--no-progress`    | off          | Disable the TTY progress bar; emit JSON logs only (auto-off in non-TTY).                     |
| `--dry-run`        | off          | List object IDs the integration sees without writing any files.                              |
| `--out <dir>`      | `./exports`  | Output directory for the stamped export (overrides `OUT_DIR`).                               |
| `--retention <n>`  | `0`          | Keep only the last N stamped exports under `--out`. `0` = keep all (overrides `RETENTION`).  |

## Desktop launcher & automation

The optional [`launcher/`](launcher/) folder wraps the CLI in a cross-platform
convenience layer: one command (or one click) to pull the latest code, rebuild,
run an `export`, and open the result — plus an opt-in daily schedule.

| Front-end        | Run it                                                                | Platform |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Terminal UI      | `node launcher/tui.mjs`                                               | any      |
| One-shot CLI     | `node launcher/refresh.mjs [flags]`                                  | any      |
| Windows tray app | double-click `launcher/windows/launch.vbs` (Update / Export / Open / daily schedule) | Windows  |

`refresh.mjs` flags: `--no-open`, `--no-update` (export only), `--no-export`
(update only). Full design, plus the Windows desktop-icon and scheduled-task
setup, is documented in [`launcher/README.md`](launcher/README.md).

## Two things to know before you start

**The first export is slow, and that is Notion's API, not this tool.** Everything
is fetched through a rate-limited client (`NOTION_MIN_TIME` 150 ms between calls,
`NOTION_MAX_CONCURRENT` 4), because the alternative is a wall of 429s. A page costs
at least one request and usually several — its block tree is paginated, and databases
add a query per view. On a real workspace of ~830 pages and databases with ~660
assets, that is thousands of sequential-ish requests: budget **tens of minutes to a
few hours** for a cold run, and leave it going. This is the shape of the problem, not
a bug to report.

The good news is that you pay it once. Incremental mode is on by default, so later
runs re-fetch only pages whose `last_edited_time` moved and skip the rest — typically
minutes. A crash mid-export resumes rather than starting over. Raising
`NOTION_MAX_CONCURRENT` mostly buys you 429s and backoff; the defaults are chosen
to be boringly reliable overnight.

**The HTML output is opinionated, and the opinions are the author's.** The renderer
was built against one real workspace and its conventions, so the styling, sidebar
layout, database view heuristics (`auto` picks kanban when a database is grouped by
status/select, else table) and touches like `STYLE_BACK_LINKS` reflect how those
pages happen to be written. It is deliberately not a neutral, theme-agnostic
exporter yet. Expect to want changes if your workspace looks different — the styles
are split into small modules under `src/export/styles/` and the Markdown converter is
extensible per block type, so this is meant to be edited rather than fought. Issues
and PRs that generalise a hardcoded assumption are the most welcome kind.

If you only want the data and not the presentation, `raw/*.json` and `markdown/` are
untouched by any of this.

## Configuration

All settings come from environment variables (or a `.env` / `.env.local` file
in the working directory). See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for a copy-paste
starting point.

### Core

| Var            | Type   | Default              | Meaning                                                       |
| -------------- | ------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NOTION_TOKEN` | string | _(required)_         | Internal integration token (`secret_…`).                      |
| `OUT_DIR`      | string | `./exports`          | Parent directory for timestamped export dirs.                 |
| `RETENTION`    | int    | `0`                  | Keep only the N newest stamped exports. `0` = keep all.       |
| `LOG_LEVEL`    | enum   | `info`               | One of `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.             |

### Output

| Var                 | Type        | Default              | Meaning                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `EXPORT_TITLE`      | string      | `Your Notion archive` | Workspace title shown in the HTML sidebar header.                                                |
| `EXPORT_ICON`       | string      | `📚`                  | Single emoji glyph, or a path (relative to `html/`) to an image used as the sidebar icon.        |
| `EXPORT_ROW_MEDIA`  | bool        | `true`               | Download per-row cover/icon images on databases. Set `false` to skip media on huge galleries.    |
| `EXPORT_DB_VIEW`    | enum        | `auto`               | Database view layout: `auto` (kanban when grouped by status/select, else table), `table`, or `kanban`. |
| `EXPAND_CHILD_PAGES`| bool        | `true`               | Walk block trees to discover subpages `search` misses. Disable only if `search` already returns everything. |
| `PRETTY_RAW_JSON`   | bool        | `true`               | Pretty-print `raw/*.json`. Set `false` for compact JSON on very large workspaces.                |
| `STYLE_BACK_LINKS`  | bool        | `false`              | Style "↩️ Back to …" links below an H1 as a pill — opt-in personal convention.                  |

### Performance

| Var                  | Type | Default | Meaning                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ---- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ASSET_CONCURRENCY`  | int  | `16`    | Parallel asset downloads (1–64).                                                                      |
| `PAGE_CONCURRENCY`   | int  | `4`     | Parallel page renders (1–32).                                                                         |
| `CRAWL_CONCURRENCY`  | int  | `8`     | Parallel block-tree walks during discovery (1–32).                                                    |

### Notion API

| Var                    | Type | Default | Meaning                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NOTION_MIN_TIME`      | int  | `150`   | Min ms between API calls (Bottleneck `minTime`).                         |
| `NOTION_MAX_CONCURRENT`| int  | `4`     | Max concurrent in-flight Notion requests.                                |
| `NOTION_MAX_RETRIES`   | int  | `8`     | Retries on 429 / 5xx with exponential backoff.                           |

```

## Reprocessing without re-fetching

Two operations skip the Notion API entirely and reuse what's already on disk:

```bash
# Renderer changed? Regenerate md/html/sitemap/search from raw/ JSON.
pnpm dev rerender
pnpm dev rerender --export ./exports/2026-05-29T14-00-00Z

# Some assets failed (expired S3 URL, transient network)? Refresh just those.
pnpm dev repair
pnpm dev repair --export ./exports/2026-05-29T14-00-00Z
```

Both default to the most recent export under `OUT_DIR` when `--export` is omitted.

## Restore

The Notion API does not support full restore programmatically. This tool is a
**backup / archive**, not a sync. Keep the `raw/` JSON and `assets/` — if you
need a page back, drag the Markdown file into Notion or use
[Notion's import](https://www.notion.so/help/import-data-into-notion). This is
by design; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the rationale.

## View modes

Inline databases pick one of four HTML layouts at render time. The
default is `auto`; the `%%notion-exporter` fence (see below) and the
`EXPORT_DB_VIEW` env var can both override it.

| Mode      | Picked when                                                                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `table`   | Default. Full table chrome with sortable headers and filter chips.                           |
| `kanban`  | DB is grouped by a `status` or `select` property (auto) or forced via fence / env override.  |
| `gallery` | Rows carry cover images (auto when covers are present).                                      |
| `compact` | DB is nested inside a `column_list`, has ≤ 8 rows, and no cover images — renders as a quiet card list. |

## Recipes

### Per-database view config

Drop a `%%notion-exporter` fence into a database's description in Notion
and the renderer will read it on every export / rerender:

```
%%notion-exporter
{"view":"kanban","groupBy":"Status","order":["Todo","Doing","Done"]}
%%
```

The body is **JSON** (not YAML — a YAML-shaped body is rejected with a
warn log). All five keys are optional:

| Key           | Type                | Effect                                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `view`        | `table \| kanban \| gallery \| compact` | Force a specific layout, bypassing the `auto` heuristic and `EXPORT_DB_VIEW`.       |
| `groupBy`     | string              | Property name to group on for kanban view (must be `status` / `select` / `multi_select`).               |
| `order`       | string[]            | Explicit column order. Beats the canonical schema order and `STATUS_RANK`. Unlisted columns trail.       |
| `hideFilters` | boolean             | Hide the filter strip on inline DB views (chips, range filters, sort dropdown).                          |
| `cardMeta`    | string[]            | Property names to surface as meta lines under each kanban / gallery / compact card title.                |

### Verify colour contrast (WCAG-AA)

```bash
pnpm contrast
```

One-shot check of every text/background swatch in `src/export/styles.ts`
against WCAG-AA in both light and dark themes. CI runs this on every PR;
run it locally after touching any colour value.

### Nightly cron (Linux/macOS)

```cron
0 3 * * *  cd /srv/notion-exporter && /usr/bin/env NOTION_TOKEN=$(cat .token) node dist/cli.js export --retention 30 >> log 2>&1
```

### docker-compose with Nextcloud sync

> The `ghcr.io/dmetzner/notion-exporter` image is published by the
> release workflow on `v*.*.*` tags — available after the first tagged
> release. Until then, build locally with `docker build -t notion-exporter .`
> and swap the `image:` line for `image: notion-exporter`.

```yaml
services:
  notion-exporter:
    image: ghcr.io/dmetzner/notion-exporter:latest
    environment:
      NOTION_TOKEN: ${NOTION_TOKEN}
      RETENTION: "30"
    volumes:
      - /mnt/nextcloud-sync/Notion-Backup:/exports
    restart: "no"
```

Schedule the container with a cron or systemd timer; the Nextcloud client
picks up the output on its own.

### GitHub Action (push backup to a private repo)

```yaml
name: Notion backup
on:
  schedule: [{ cron: "0 3 * * *" }]
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  backup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npx notion-exporter@latest export --out backup --retention 30
        env:
          NOTION_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NOTION_TOKEN }}
      - run: |
          git config user.email backup@example.com
          git config user.name "Backup Bot"
          git add backup && git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -m "backup $(date -u +%FT%TZ)"
          git push
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev export    # run from source via tsx
pnpm test          # vitest run
pnpm typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
pnpm lint          # biome
pnpm build         # tsup → dist/cli.js
```
